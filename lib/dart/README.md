# frugal

[Frugal](https://github.com/Workiva/frugal) is an extension of 
[Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) which provides additional 
functionality. Specifically, it includes support for request headers, 
request multiplexing, thread safety, and code-generated pub/sub APIs. 
Frugal is intended to act as a superset of Thrift, meaning it implements 
the same functionality as Thrift with some additional features. For a 
more detailed explanation, see the
[documentation](https://github.com/samjxn/frugal/tree/master/documentation).

An [example](https://github.com/samjxn/frugal/tree/master/examples) of 
using Frugal (including a dart client) is provided.
